“Pocket Risk is a fantastic tool that has become a key component of our discovery process with clients. I came across Pocket Risk after using a similar online risk questionnaire that just didn’t consistently represent the client’s true risk tolerance.<br><br>
It’s been a relief to find a tool that I have confidence in, and is so simple for the client to use.”
