# Clear file cache, WordPress 4.9

A plugin to make it easy for theme developers to clear the new file cache on WordPress 4.9.

I believe 4.9.1 will have an update so the file cache is disabled when WP_DEBUG is set to true. But in the meantime, you can use this plugin.

## How To Use
1. Download this PHP file.
2. Put PHP file in "wp-content/plugins" folder.
3. Activate plugin under "Plugins".
4. Use "Clear File Cache" button in the top admin bar.
